#### Comments

Subject #1 - Used Spotify before, prefers Spotify for its variety and aesthetics.

Subject #2 - Used both before, says they're both good.

Subject #3 - Used Spotify before, preferred Spotify.

Subject #4 - Used Pandora before, says Pandora does not get it. 

Subject #5 - Used both before, prefers Spotify

Subject #6 - Used both before, doesn't like either pandora or spotify, listens to music on youtube

Subject #7 - Never used either, is going to start using pandora. Doesnt like spotify, its too complicated

Subject #8 - Used both, doesnt use either much, pandora is easier to use and introduces to more new stuff. spotify is better for individual songs

Subject #9 - I like Pandora better because of the variety of songs a station will give you. But spotify gives you more options on selection and  you can specify which songs you want to play. 

Subject #10 - Pandora better because of playlists- radio - plays stuff like it that’s not the same artist
