#Spotify Vs. Pandora
##Usability and Design
###Author: Flanders Lorton

#Data Collection
We measured users based on the time it took them to do various tasks for each music streaming service. The tasks included: Liking a song, Making a station/playlist, Playing a song by the Beach Boys, and Following a band or person.

#### Errors

Subject #1 - Spotify - made an error in making a playlist by ‘liking’ a song instead

Subject #3 - Spotify - Initially added song to queue instead of actual playlist.

Subject #4 - Did not know how to get to the band’s page for the first 10 seconds for Pandora. Did not know how to add song to playlist for Spotify

Subject #7 - Spotify - Had to be shown link to web player for Spotify, Made playlist, but could not figure out how to play it. Couldn't find option to like a song.

Subject #8 - Spotify - Had to be shown link to web player / tried to use help, but help didn't load in. Clicked like button, but did not register the vote. 

Subject #11 - Clicking random stuff couldn’t find button in Spotify. Didn’t know thumbs down was for removing song in Pandora.  

Subject #12 - Misspelled and went to random page in Spotify. Hard to add song to playlist didn’t use right click or drag song in Pandora.


#### Comments

Subject #1 - Used Spotify before, prefers Spotify for its variety and aesthetics.

Subject #2 - Used both before, says they're both good.

Subject #3 - Used Spotify before, preferred Spotify.

Subject #4 - Used Pandora before, says Pandora does not get it. 

Subject #5 - Used both before, prefers Spotify

Subject #6 - Used both before, doesn't like either pandora or spotify, listens to music on youtube

Subject #7 - Never used either, is going to start using pandora. Doesnt like spotify, its too complicated

Subject #8 - Used both, doesnt use either much, pandora is easier to use and introduces to more new stuff. spotify is better for individual songs

Subject #9 - I like Pandora better because of the variety of songs a station will give you. But spotify gives you more options on selection and  you can specify which songs you want to play. 

Subject #10 - Pandora better because of playlists- radio - plays stuff like it that’s not the same artist

Subject #11 - Never used either/ not tech savy, said it is hard to understand spotify,  pandora just plays after typing in.

Subject #12 - Never used either/ very not tech savy, said Pandora was easier just type into listen to.


#Data Analysis
Since we had different group members collecting data for different subjects, the data is not necessarily standardized, and we are missing data for some subjects. There was also some confusion in how many songs the user needed to add to a playlist for the Spotify section. However, we still have full data for 3 tasks from 10 people, so anything else is just extra information. 

Also it is important to note that even though Spotify does have the feature to make a radio station, we chose to instead compare Pandora's station feature to Spotify's playlist feature. Although these are not exactly the same, they are each site's key feature, so I think they give better information for usability metrics.

For analysis, I have chose to first find the ratio between the times for each music service per person per task.

| Subject # | Liking a Song Spotify/Pandora | Making a Station Spotify/Pandora | Play Beach Boys Spotify/Pandora | Follow Person/Band Spotify/Pandora |
|------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1 (KT) | 11 | 3.29 |  | 1.75 |
| 2 (AL) | 38 | 40 |  | 0.67 |
| 3 (DG) | 2.2 | 5.67 |  | 0.57 |
| 4 (AK) | 82 | 85 |  | 0.33 |
| 5 (MG) | 0.55 | 4 |  | 0.26 |
| 6 (FL) | 4.4 | 9.7 | 2.8 | 0.78 |
| 7 (MH) | n/a | 9.4 | 3 | 0.48 |
| 8 (JT) | n/a | 3.1 | 9.4 | 0.68 |
| 9 (AG) | 6.25 | 1.86 |  | 0.69 |
| 10 (D) | 1.9 | 0.43 |  | 0.08 |
| 11 (R) |  | 2.66 | 1.38 | 0.35 |
| 12 (K) |  | 2.21 | 0.29 | 0.35 |

From here, I averaged the ratios for each task. These numbers are the the Spotify times divided by the Pandora times. So the numbers signify Pandora is x times faster, and if the number is below one, then Pandora is 1/x times slower. 

| Subject # | Liking a Song Spotify/Pandora | Making a Station Spotify/Pandora | Play Beach Boys Spotify/Pandora | Follow Person/Band Spotify/Pandora |
|------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Averages | 18.9 | 13.94 | 3.37 | 0.66 |

What do these numbers tell us? They show that for the people we measured, Pandora is much faster at every task other than following a person/band. Liking a song was 19 times faster in Pandora, Making a station was 14 times faster in Pandora, and although there was not much data for this task, from what we tested, even just playing any single artist was almost 3.5 times faster in Pandora. Following an artist/person was 1.5 times faster in Spotify. 

Having observed these trials, and looking at the two sites, these numbers are not at all surprising, and can mostly be attributed to design and usability, however there are some other factors. Though Pandora is definitely faster at some of these tasks, it is clear that these numbers do not mean that one service is necessarily better than the other.

# Usability Metrics

## Learnability
About half of our test users had no experience with one or both music streaming websites, and even some of those who had experience, hadn't used them for a long time, so they went through a similar process of re-learning. 

Users found tasks in Pandora very simple. There is a very obvious search bar which both plays an artist and creates a station simultaneously. The like and dislike buttons are obvious, and the songs are randomized, so there is little need to continue to move around the site after music has started playing.

Spotify, on the other hand, is less intuitive. The biggest issue is one that is ridiculously easy to fix. From the main page of Spotify, you can easily get to the download link for their app, but the link for the web player is hidden. It is in small purple text on a yellow background. There is also a small link at the very bottom of every page next to links for the the legal and contact sections. 

![I Even Had To Zoom Out](http://puu.sh/klVjG/796114d5e0.png)

Once you manage to find the web player, most functionality in Spotify is fairly simple, but there are quite a few more buttons than Pandora, some of which do different things whether you click them once or twice. If you have used the site before, this may not be an issue, but from a learnability standpoint, Pandora is the clear winner. Also, it is notable that the like and dislike buttons are only available in Spotify's radio feature, not normal music playback, which could possibly cause some confusion.

## Efficiency 

Pandora does its job very well, and is extremely efficient. There is really only one main page on Pandora, which I pictured earlier. This doesn't leave a lot of room for users to be confused. The one task in which Pandora performed worse is following a person/artist. This is one of the few things in Pandora which requires navigating to a separate page. In spotify there is a very obvious "Follow" link, whereas in Pandora, it can be accessed from either the "Music Feed" page, "Find People" section, or though a redirect from the "My Profile", "Following" tab. Many subjects in our tests tried to use the "Search Friends" box on the profile screen to find someone even though they were not logged in on Facebook. I do not think this shortcoming for Pandora is significant because following a friend is not a main focus of the site.

Where Pandora does one task very well, Spotify tries to have many focuses, making it quite a bit more cumbersome, but also allows for more functionality. While Pandora is for creating radio stations which shuffle based on an artist, Spotify is focused on playing specific tracks and making playlists. Spotify is more akin to the interface of Itunes, and is not as easily streamlined as shuffling internet radio. However, from my observations and the data we collected, I think Spotify could definitely do a better job making its interface intuitive.

Also, the playlist system is a little strange. I think it is because the site relies on use of both buttons for the main sections, which are present on every screen, and tabs which change depending what page you are on. It feels odd because if you are unfamiliar with the site, you may need to switch around between pages for the tab you are looking. There is nothing really about the "Your Music" tab that implies playlists, you have to click on it, then have the presence to see the "playlists" tab. Perhaps this is more of a learnability issue than an efficiency issue, but I think even if you have experience using the site, this system could make for a confusing workflow.

## Satisfaction

Despite Spotify's flaws, about half of our our test users still prefer the service. This is simply due to the fact that they are tailored for different purposes. One of my friends works for Pandora and I jokingly asked her if it's blasphemy to play Spotify in Pandora offices. She replied saying of course not, they play Spotify all the time and at Spotify offices they likely play Pandora. One service is good if you are perhaps at a party or event where you do not have time to dj, and just want constant music playing. The other is good for picking specific songs and fills a previous gap in the music software field for users who want to hear their favorite band, but do not want to pay per song.

Users of Pandora like it because it's simple to use and shows them new music. Users of Spotify like being able to play specific tracks, its aesthetics, and its added features. However, having said this, I believe Spotify could do well to improve its learnability, and make the link to the web player more obvious.
